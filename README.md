# Multiply operation using SOAP API

Android Java app to demo SOAP based APIs.

SOAP API: Mutliply two integers [http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx]

I've used KSoap library for this project<br/>


This demo shows how to use KSoap to access SOAP APIs in an Android app. The API I've used is a fairly simple two which accepts an integers. One value is accepted via editText and then multiplies it with 20. Calls API to multiply and shows the result.
